1) Init Function : In init function O(n) time will be required to read input from user,
during generation of expression tree each character is visited only once(i.e. O(n) time complexity),
for this internal stack functions are used having O(1) time complexity so overall time complexity will be, 
	Init Fun time complexity = O(n) + O(n) + O(1) = O(n)


2) Traverse Function : In traverse function each node is visited only once.
	Traverse fun time complexity = O(n)

3) Compute Function : In compute function each node is visited only once(i.e. O(n) time complexity) with internal subexpression is evaluated in O(1) time complexity , so overall time complexity will be, 
	Compute Fun time complexity = O(n) + O(1) = O(n)
